# NLP Audio Language Detection

This project uses audio processing and machine learning techniques to detect the language spoken in audio files. The dataset includes audio samples in multiple languages such as English, German, and Spanish, and leverages Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as features for classification.

---

## Features
- **Audio Preprocessing:** Convert audio files into mono-channel, 22 kHz format.
- **Feature Extraction:** Use MFCCs for extracting meaningful features from audio signals.
- **Visualization:** Waveplot and spectrogram visualization for audio samples.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for audio classification.
- **Language Detection:** Identify languages (English, German, Spanish) from audio files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-audio-language-detection.git
   cd nlp-audio-language-detection
   ```

2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Main Libraries Used:**
   - NumPy
   - Pandas
   - Librosa
   - Matplotlib
   - TensorFlow
   - scikit-learn
   - Seaborn

3. Ensure you have the audio dataset in the specified directory structure. Update the `train_path` variable in the code to point to your dataset directory.

---

## Usage

1. **Preprocess Audio Data:**
   - Load audio files using `librosa`.
   - Extract features such as MFCCs and save them for model training.

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Run the training script to fit the CNN model on extracted features.
   - Use the saved dataset (`feature_data.csv`) to avoid redundant processing.

3. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Check the accuracy using confusion matrices and classification reports.
   - Visualize model performance with training and validation metrics.

4. **Predict Language:**
   - Use the trained model to predict the language of new audio samples.

## Visualization

1. **Waveplots:**
   - Represent audio amplitude over time.
   - Example: Waveplot of German voice.

2. **MFCC Spectrogram:**
   - Visualize the extracted MFCC features.

## Model Architecture

The project uses a CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras. Key layers include:
- Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling for dimensionality reduction
- Dense Layers for final predictions
- Batch Normalization and Dropout to prevent overfitting

---

## Results

- The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy for classifying languages.
- Example confusion matrix and accuracy metrics are included in the notebook.

---

## Future Work
- Extend to additional languages.
- Improve the model by experimenting with more advanced architectures (e.g., transformers).
- Use real-world noisy audio data for better generalization.
